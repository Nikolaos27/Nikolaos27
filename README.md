# Passionate about transforming data into actionable insights, I thrive on working with Python and SQL to harness the power of statistics and programming. My expertise lies in not just analyzing data, but in distilling it into meaningful information, compelling visualizations, and valuable trends. With a solid foundation in mathematics, underscored by a Master's degree in Mathematics, and complemented by a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, I bring a unique blend of analytical prowess and business acumen. Having recently transitioned from a 15-year career as a mathematics teacher to complete a one-year data analyst training program, I am eager to apply my honed skills and extensive background to a dynamic role in data analysis
